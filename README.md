Project Description The Task Management System (TMS) is a comprehensive web-based solution designed to enhance organizational efficiency by streamlining workforce and task management. It provides administrators and employees with a centralized platform to manage tasks, attendance, skills, and performance, thereby improving collaboration, accountability, and productivity.

By integrating user role management, skill-based task assignment, and real-time attendance tracking, the system ensures that tasks are delegated to qualified personnel and progress is monitored effectively. Employees can easily manage their assignments, update task statuses, and log attendance, while managers gain valuable insights through performance analytics to optimize resource allocation and decision-making.

Built with a robust database architecture and security mechanisms—including role-based access control and audit trails—the system is scalable and reliable for businesses of all sizes. The user-friendly front-end interface, developed with responsive design principles and form validations, guarantees an intuitive experience across devices.

This project addresses common challenges in manual or outdated employee management systems by providing a modern, automated, and secure platform that reduces human error, simplifies administrative tasks, and enhances overall workforce management.
